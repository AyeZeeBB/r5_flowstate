# About me and this project
I'm an Apex Legends nerd and full time modder. I also create content for Skeptation's YouTube channel.

I'm from Colombia and I don't have a job other than modding Apex, in this country 1 dollar is a lot. 
If you enjoy the mod and want to support me, please consider a donation: https://ko-fi.com/r5r_colombia

I know all the code can be masivelly improved and there are a lot of things that are working with tape and glue, I'm still learning so if you have any feedback about code, challenges improvements, or new ideas in general, I'll really appreciate it. Feel free to leave me a dm in discord.
