Hi, I'm Caf√© de Colombia. I hope you are well today.

Working gungame with lastest Mechanics Grinding v1.4 update.

Gungame: You kill, you get different weapon.
Gungame + Shield progression: You start with white and if you get kill streak you get better shield. 2 kills to blue, 5 kills to purple.

1. There are two modes of the gungame gamemode in the vscripts/gamemodes/custom_tdm/gungame folder, you have to choose one.

2. Make a backup of your previous _gamemode_custom_tdm.nut in vscripts/gamemodes/custom_tdm/ file, rename the gungame file selected and paste it there. It must have this name: _gamemode_custom_tdm.nut

4. In your custom_tdm section in the playlist,  this is playlists_r5_patch.txt in platform folder:

				respawn_kit_enabled                   1
				//respawn_kit_primary_weapon          "mp_weapon_wingman optic_cq_hcog_classic highcal_mag_l3"
				respawn_kit_secondary_weapon  "mp_weapon_r97 barrel_stabilizer_l4_flash_hider optic_cq_hcog_classic bullets_mag_l3 stock_tactical_l3"
				//respawn_kit_tactical                "mp_ability_phase_walk"
				//respawn_kit_ultimate                "mp_ability_3dash"

Please leave primary weapon, tactical and ultimate disabled.

3.  In your custom_tdm section in the playlist also add this:
